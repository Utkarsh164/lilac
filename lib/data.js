    content: `Many people who struggle with anxiety appear successful, capable, and composed on the outside. Internally, however, they may feel constantly tense, overthink every decision, and struggle to relax. High-functioning anxiety often hides behind productivity and perfectionism.

In therapy, we explore how this pattern develops and how the nervous system stays on high alert even when life looks stable. Learning to notice early signs of stress and creating space for rest can help shift this cycle over time.`

    content: `Trauma is not only stored as a memory. It is often held in the body through muscle tension, shallow breathing, and chronic alertness. Many clients are surprised to learn that their physical symptoms are connected to emotional experiences.

Body-oriented and mindfulness-based approaches can help clients gently reconnect with their bodies and feel safer in the present moment. This work is done slowly and with care, emphasizing stability and regulation.`

Therapy can provide a space to slow down, examine expectations, and develop more sustainable ways of working and living. Recovery from burnout is not about quitting responsibility, but about building healthier boundaries and self-awareness.`

Over time, therapy can help people understand how past experiences continue to shape their present reactions and relationships. This process supports both symptom relief and deeper self-trust.`
